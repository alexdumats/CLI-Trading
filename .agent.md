# .agent.md â€” Assistant Guardrails

- Use targeted, minimal diffs. Avoid rewriting large files without necessity.
- Before edits, open and quote the relevant code sections.
- When creating new files, prefer small, purpose-specific modules.
- Never modify secrets, CI/CD workflows, or lockfiles unless explicitly requested by the user.
- After edits, run local checks: format, compose build/up, and service `/health`.
- When touching message bus (Redis Streams) or DB migrations, call out backward-compat and rollout steps.
- For VS Code restarts, re-hydrate context: open `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, `README.md`, and the changed service files.
